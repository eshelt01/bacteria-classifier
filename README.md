# bacteria-classifier
Classifier for images of different species of bacteria using convolutional neural networks.
A transfer learning approach in Tensorflow is used, with VGG, Inception and ResNet model. The performance of these models are compared.

The bacteria dataset can be found as in the public DIBaS bacterial dataset, which contains microscopy images of 33 different species of bacteria.
